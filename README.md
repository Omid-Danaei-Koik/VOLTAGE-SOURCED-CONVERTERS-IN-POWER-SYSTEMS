# **MATLAB Simulations: Examples from "Voltage-Sourced Converters in Power Systems"**

This repository contains 14 MATLAB simulation files based on the examples presented in the book *Voltage-Sourced Converters in Power Systems* by Amirnaser Yazdani (University of Western Ontario) and Reza Iravani (University of Toronto). These simulations were developed using MATLAB R2017a and are compatible with later versions. Simulink has been utilized as the primary tool for these models.
